Windows Terminal:

Windows Terminal requires special handling to be applied which makes the background, tab row and tabs transparent.

From the Immersive UX GUI, you can apply this special handling by selecting Patch Terminal in the Special Handling menu.

These special handling changes happen immediately without the need to restart Windows Terminal.


Visual Studio 2022:

It works with the default Dark theme that comes with Visual Studio. However, for best results install Vanta Black (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrijeshRathod.PitchBlackV1) Visual Studio theme.


Visual Studio Code & VSCodium:

Special handling is required to make the Electon layers transparent in order to be able to apply background materials and blur.

From the Immersive UX GUI, you can apply this special handling by selecting Patch VSCode in the Special Handling menu. This will patch the Electron files required to allow transparency. This patching gets undone with each update of Visual Studio Code or VSCodium. Therefore you will need to patch it after each update.

These special handling changes require closing and restarting VSCode/VSCodium if they were running at the time of patching.
